# 7.5, claim (2): the induction frame

PAPER (proof of 7.5, claim (2), printed p. 36):

*"(2) If `F ⊆ V(G)` is connected and some vertex of `S` has a neighbour in `F`, and so does some
vertex of `T`, and `F ∩ (X₀ ∪ X₁ ∪ Y) = ∅`, then the theorem holds.*

*We shall prove this by induction on `|F|`; so, we assume it holds for all smaller choices of `F`
(even for different choices of `L(H)`)."*

`Workspace.ProofLemmas.Thm75Claim2.thm75Claim2` fixes one appearance `L(H)` and one `F`, which
is the shape the rest of §7.5 consumes but is **not** a shape one can induct in: the parenthesis
*"even for different choices of `L(H)`"* says the inductive hypothesis has to be available for
every smaller `F` **and simultaneously for every other appearance of `J` in `G`**.  This module
is that frame.  Everything except `G`, `hG`, `J`, `hJ` and the size bound `n` is universally
quantified **inside** the statement, so `induction n` gives exactly the printed induction
hypothesis.

## Why `F.ncard ≤ n` with `induction n` is the right frame

Two places in the printed argument consume the inductive hypothesis, and they consume it in
different directions:

* **The `b₁b₂ ≠ c₁c₂` branch**, after the rung replacement: *"Since there is a proper subset `F′`
  of `F` with attachments in `S` and in the new set `T′` in `V(H′)` corresponding to `T` … it
  follows that we may apply the inductive hypothesis."*  Here both `F` and the appearance change
  — `F′ ⊊ F` and `L(H)` becomes `L(H′)` — so an induction that fixed the appearance would be
  useless.  With this frame, `F′.ncard ≤ n - 1` and `H′` is just another value of the inner
  `∀ m H K φ`, so the induction hypothesis applies verbatim.
* **The opening reduction**, before 5.8 is even reached: *"Hence we may assume that `G|F` is a
  path with vertices `f₁,…,fₙ`, where `f₁` is the only vertex of `F` with a neighbour in `S`, and
  `fₙ` the only vertex with a neighbour in `T`"*, and *"From the minimality of `F` it also follows
  that `F` is disjoint from `L(H)`; for any vertex of `F` in `L(H)` would be in `S` or `T`, since
  it is not in `X₁`, and then we could make `F` shorter by omitting this vertex.  Consequently
  `F ∩ X = ∅`."*  Both sentences are appeals to the inductive hypothesis on a **proper subset**
  of `F` with the same appearance — the paper phrases them as "minimality of `F`", which is the
  same thing read contrapositively.  They too are covered by `F.ncard ≤ n` at the smaller value.

`F.ncard ≤ n` (rather than `F.ncard = n`) is what makes both appeals one-liners: any proper
subset of an `F` with `F.ncard ≤ n + 1` has cardinality `≤ n`.

## Relation to the frozen statement

`Workspace.ProofLemmas.Thm75Claim2.thm75Claim2` is stated for `H : SimpleGraph W` with `W` an
arbitrary finite type, whereas this frame uses `H : SimpleGraph (Fin m)` so that the induction
stays in `Type 0` and so that the appearance produced by the rung replacement
(`Workspace.ProofLemmas.Thm75AppearanceFromRungReplacement`, which lands in `Fin m`) is directly
an instance of the quantifier.  `thm75Claim2` follows from this by transporting the appearance
along `SimpleGraph.Iso.map (Fintype.equivFin W) H`, exactly as
`Workspace.ProofLemmas.AppearanceVertexTypeTransport` (namespace `Thm75Claim2Transport`) does for
`five8W` and `enlargementFromNonlocalAttachmentPathW`; instantiate `n := Fintype.card V` to
discharge the size bound.  **`Thm75Claim2.lean` is frozen and is not edited here.**

The seven proof-local sets `X, X₀, X₁, Rset, S, T, F` and the six equations defining the first
six of them are copied from `thm75Claim2`'s own binder list, with `Sym2 W` becoming
`Sym2 (Fin m)`; the conclusion is copied from `thm75Claim2`'s conclusion.  (Its existential
binders `m` and `n` shadow the outer `m` and `n`; that is the frozen text and is left alone.)

**Status: statement only — this module is a work item.**
