# Statement 9.3, as printed, is false

A self-contained counterexample.  Every hypothesis of `Workspace.Statements.S09.SPGT.thm_9_3`
holds of the configuration below, and the conclusion **as printed in the paper** fails; this is
bundled as the single theorem `printed_nine_three_false`.

The graph has eleven vertices.  On `{0,…,9}` it is the complement of the line graph of the
bipartite subdivision of `K₄` with square `0-1-2-3-0` and diagonal branches `0-4-5-6-2` and
`1-7-3`, whose ten edges are labelled `a₁,b₁,a₂,b₂,x₁,z₁,z₂,y₁,x₂,y₂` in that order; those ten
vertices carry the knot `([0,1], [2,3], [4,5,6,7], [8,9])` and are its `K`.  Vertex `10` is a
*twin of `x₁` in `Ḡ`* — its `Ḡ`-neighbourhood inside `K` is `{b₁, b₂, z₁} = {1,3,5}`, exactly
that of `x₁` — and it lies **outside** `K`, which is what makes `F = {10} ⊆ Kᶜ` hold.

Eleven vertices is forced, not chosen: a knot needs `|K| ≥ 8`; the antipath `Q₁` must be long
for outcome 9.3.4 to bite; 9.1 makes its track length even, so `|V(Q₁)| ≥ 4` and `|K| ≥ 10`;
and `F` needs one more.

**This does not contradict the repository's `thm_9_3`.**  That theorem carries the approved
repair of outcome 9.3.4 — `∃ w, (w ∈ Q₁ ∨ w ∈ Q₂) ∧ w ∉ Q' ∧ w ≠ x ∧ ¬ G.Adj f w` in place of
the printed `¬ G.Adj f y` — and this configuration *satisfies* the repaired conclusion, with
witness `w = 5` (`repaired_conclusion11`).  The two results together pin the repair exactly:
the printed clause genuinely fails here, the weakened clause genuinely holds.

A different, ten-vertex graph lives in `Workspace.ProofLemmas.Thm93CaseTwoCounterexample`.  It
is **not** a counterexample to 9.3 — it puts `F` inside `K`, violating `hFsub` — and exists to
certify that the hypothesis `hfK : f ∉ K` of
`Thm93GapLemmas.case_two_nonmajor_five_eight_endgame_gap` is necessary.  Nothing here depends
on it.

/-! ## An adjusted counterexample: `F` genuinely outside the knot

The graph above puts `F` **inside** `K`, so it refutes the frozen gap lemma rather than 9.3
itself.  Adjusting it removes that defect.  Keep the same knot on `{0,…,9}`, and add one new
vertex `10` which is a *twin of* `x₁ = 4` in `Ḡ`: its `Ḡ`-neighbourhood inside `K` is
`{b₁, b₂, z₁} = {1, 3, 5}`, exactly that of `x₁`.  Now

* `K = {0,…,9}` and `F = {10}`, so `F ⊆ Kᶜ` **holds** (`F_subset_compl11`);
* the printed conclusion of 9.3 still fails (`not_conclusion11`);
* the **repaired** conclusion holds, with witness `w = 5` (`repaired_conclusion11`), which is
  the precise sense in which the approved repair of 9.3.4 is not too weak.

Eleven vertices is forced: a knot needs `|K| ≥ 8`, the antipath `Q₁` must be long for 9.3.4 to
bite, and 9.1 makes its track length even, so `|V(Q₁)| ≥ 4` and `|K| ≥ 10`; one more vertex is
needed for `F`. -/

Appearances *do* exist here — by 9.2 the knot itself is one — so they cannot be excluded by a
degree count.  Instead: in `L(H)` a vertex has degree `4` exactly when its edge joins two
branch-vertices (a track of length `1`), and degree `3` exactly when one end is a branch-vertex,
which happens twice per track of length `≥ 2`.  With six tracks this gives
`2·#deg₄ + #deg₃ = 12`.  For `graph11ᶜ` that identity forces `#deg₄ ≥ 4`, i.e. four tracks of
length `1`; bipartite parity then makes those four a `4`-cycle through all four branch-vertices,
so the appearance is degenerate and no branch has odd length `≥ 3`. -/
